      <h1>Publisher&rsquo;s Description</h1>
      <p>A prominent scientist and scholar documents and explains the thoughts, actions, and legacies of spiritual ecology&rsquo;s pioneers from ancient times to the present, demonstrating how the movement may offer the last chance to restore a healthy relationship between humankind and nature.</p>
      <p>Secular approaches to the environmental crisis have certainly made substantial inroads since the first Earth Day in 1970. Yet, the crisis not only persists, but is getting worse. Happily, there is an additional approach developing&mdash;spiritual ecology. Drawing on the wisdom of centuries and a wealth of different traditions, spiritual ecology can generate the profound transformations that are required if ecosanity is to be restored.</p>
      <p>An internet search for &ldquo;Spiritual Ecology&rdquo; and related terms like &ldquo;Religion and Nature&rdquo; and &ldquo;Religion and Ecology&rdquo; reveals tens of millions of websites. <em>Spiritual Ecology: A Quiet Revolution</em> offers an intellectual history of this far-reaching movement. Arranged chronologically, it samples major developments in the thoughts and actions of both historic and contemporary pioneers, ranging from the Buddha and St. Francis of Assisi to Wangari Maathai&rsquo;s Green Belt Movement and James Cameron&rsquo;s 2010 epic film Avatar.</p>
      <p>This foundational book is unique in that it provides a historical, cross-cultural context for understanding and advancing the ongoing spiritual ecology revolution, considering indigenous and Asian religious traditions as well as Western ones. Most chapters focus on a single pioneer, illuminating historical context and his/her legacy, while also connecting that legacy to broader concerns. Coverage includes topics as diverse as Henry David Thoreau and the Green Patriarch Bartholomew&rsquo;s decades-long promotion of environmentalism as a sacred duty for more than 250 million members of the Orthodox Church worldwide.</p>
